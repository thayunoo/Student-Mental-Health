# Student-Mental-Health
In this case, we'll conduct statistical research to analyze how students' mental health can affect their academic performance, as measured by CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). We'll use a dataset available on Kaggle that contains information on students' CGPA along with data on their sexuality, mental health, and treatment status.

The objective of this activity is to perform two types of data exploration:

Enrich the dataset by gathering metadata such as dimensions, attribute types, and summary measures;

Analyze the dataset using descriptive statistics (measures of central tendency, variability) and graphical methods to generate insights into the types of analyses that can be performed. Since this is the first time we've explored the data, some proposed analyses will be defined below to improve the focus of our studies. A case study will be defined and presented below.
