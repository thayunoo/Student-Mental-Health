# Student-Mental-Health
In this case, we'll conduct statistical research to analyze how students' mental health can affect their academic performance, as measured by CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). We'll use a dataset available on Kaggle that contains information on students' CGPA along with data on their sexuality, mental health, and treatment status.
